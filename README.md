# [Dunbar Website](https://steviev1903.github.io/react-dunbar-pages/) 

This is a fully-responsive react.js website set up as a personal project to develop further CSS skills, navigation and media queries to ensure that the components were responsive in nature to every device. 

The website is aimed at promoting my local town to encourage locals to support the local economy post covid-19 and is hosted on github pages.
